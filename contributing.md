## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, I might ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
